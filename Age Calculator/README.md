# Age Calculator

A simple age calculator web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Description
This project allows users to calculate their exact age based on their date of birth.  
The user selects a date, and the application calculates the age in years, months, and days using JavaScript logic.

## Features
- Date of birth selection using HTML date input
- Calculates age accurately based on the current date
- Displays age in years, months, and days
- Clean and minimal user interface
- Prevents selecting future dates

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript

## How It Works
- The user selects their date of birth
- On clicking the **Calculate** button, JavaScript processes the selected date
- The age is calculated using the JavaScript `Date` object
- The result is displayed dynamically on the screen
